### Pseudocode - 

Conditions: First constructing website for desktop 

1.  Include Navbar for Weather Dashboard
        (Use Bootstrap for navbar)

2. Include a right section for displaying the following under current weather conditions 
        - City
        - Date 
        - Icon image
        - Temperature 
        - Humidity
        - Wind speed
        - UV index

        Idea: Create function for current conditions - currentCondition()

3. Include a search history so that users can access their past search terms.
        - Clicking on the city name should perform a new search that returns current and future conditions for that city.

         Idea: Create function for search history - searchHistory()

4. Include a 5-day forecast below the current weather conditions. Each day for the 5-day forecast should display the following:
        - Date
        - Icon image 
        - Temperature
        - Humidity

        Idea: Create function for 5-day Forecast - fiveDayForecast()
